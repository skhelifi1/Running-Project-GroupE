## Project Title: Factors Affecting Half Marathon Runners’ Performance

### Team Members: Gabriel New, Lisa McGowan, Daniel Conrad, Sirine Khelifi

### Project Description/Outline: 

Analyzing how location, gender and age group affect the performance of half marathon runners.

### Research Questions to Answer:
1. How does training location correlate to the total time to finish the full marathon.

Alternate Hypothesis: If elevation is related to the total time to finish the full marathon then runners from a higher elevation city than the Marathon location would result in a shorter finishing time.

Null-Hypothesis:  If elevation is not related to the total time to finish the full marathon then runners from a higher elevation city than the Marathon location would not result in a shorter finishing time.

2. Does Gender affect the runners’ performance?

Alternate Hypothesis: If gender is related to the runner's performance then one gender would have a shorter finishing time than the other gender.

Null-Hypothesis: If gender is not related to the runner's performance then one gender would not have a shorter finishing time than the other gender.

3. Does age group affect the runners’ performance?

Alternate Hypothesis: If age group is related to the runner's performance then younger runners would have a shorter finishing time.

Null-Hypothesis: If age group is not related to the runner's performance then younger runners would not have a shorter finishing time.

4. Does Humidity affect the runner's performance?

Alternate Hypothesis: If humidity is related to runner's performance then runners from high humidity cities would have shorter finishing time.

Null-Hypotheses: If humidity is not related to runner's performance then runners from high humidity cities would not have shorter finishing time.

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

-Data Research

-Cleaning of Data

-Break down of coding section:

*Create Dataframe relevant to the hypothesis.
*Sort by relevant variable.
*Use Matplotlib to create charts that best represent the data.
*Use statistics such as the t-test and p-test.
*Draw conclusions

-Testing
